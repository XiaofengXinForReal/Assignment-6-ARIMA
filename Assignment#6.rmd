#The best model for my data is ARIMA(0,1,2)(1,0,0), which means that need to differentiate 2 times and need to consider no lag value for regression and has two past residuals for moving average. There is a auto-regressive factor in this model.

plot(forecast(auto_fit,h=5,level = c(99.5)))# plot of my forecast
plot(auto_fit$residuals)
Acf(auto_fit$residuals)#all the lags of residuals are close to 0.
hist(auto_fit$residuals)#the histogram of residuals skews to the left.
accuracy(auto_fit)#MASE=51.96%, is a somewhat good model.
